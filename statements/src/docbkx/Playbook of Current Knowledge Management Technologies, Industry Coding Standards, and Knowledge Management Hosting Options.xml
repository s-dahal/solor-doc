        <title>Introduction to Integrated Knowledge Management </title>
        <para>The healthcare system in America has undergone numerous changes throughout the past
            decades, most notably in the way it records, retains, and transfers medical records.
            Within these records, clinical laboratory data, including orders, results, and
            interpretations are among the most important types of data. This information is used in
            a variety of settings including clinical care, public health, and even the development
            of drugs and medical devices. </para>
        <para>With the evolution of healthcare data has come the evolution of how it’s recorded.
            Today health care and laboratory systems use terminology standards such as Logical
            Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC) and Systematized Nomenclature of
            Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®). The long-term challenge to using these standards
            is that laboratory data is often recorded differently within and between institutions,
            which impacts reliability, interoperability, accuracy, and, more critically, patient
            safety. In addition to different standards and interoperability challenges, version
            control of the knowledge standards and equivalence identification amongst standards pose
            potential patient safety issues. Data interoperability tooling is needed, such as an
            integrated Knowledge Management Platform, that can provide an implementation of a
            standardized model for health IT standards and change management would address
            differences in the management and structure across industry coding standards, local
            concepts, and codes lists/value sets. </para>

        <title>IKM Playbook Aims</title>
        <para>A product playbook is a guide for helping developers, product owners, and managers to
            build products faster, with fewer bugs and better user experience. It is a collection of
            high-level user stories and elaborated acceptance criteria. This playbook specifically
            showcases the Komet Application product and identifies necessary functionality and
            capabilities to establish a collaborative, robust, and highly reliable Knowledge
            Management Platform (KMP). It will serve as a guide for the development and
            implementation of the Komet tool and other technical components (e.g., TINKAR-core, Web
            Application), while also suggesting specific technologies and products that could be
            used in the development process.</para>
        <para>The overarching objectives of this playbook are to:</para>
