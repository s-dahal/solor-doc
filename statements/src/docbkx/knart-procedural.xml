        <para>As defined by Osheroff et al. CDS “provides clinicians, staff, patients, or other
            individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered or
            presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care.” [1] CDS encompasses
            a variety of tools to enhance decision-making in the clinical workflow. Examples of CDS
            tools include but are not limited to: </para>

        <para>In order for the vision of the AMIA CDS Roadmap Steering Committee to be achieved, the
            science of CDS needs to support implementers, clinicians, and technology vendors in
            developing CDS tools that are shareable, standards-based, publicly-available, and
            patient-centered. Namely, the translation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines
            into implementable clinical tools needs to occur in a manner that is consistent,
            systematic, and comprehensive. There have been a number of historical efforts that have
            aimed to achieve interoperable and robust CDS tools and artifacts that appropriately
            translate guidelines into care. The AHRQ depicts the following image representing the

            study. [12] In IQ-MAPLE, the investigators designed CDS interventions in the EHRs of
            four study sites to alert physicians when a candidate problem (e.g., Asthma,
            Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia) was detected that was missing from the patient's problem
            list (i.e., absence of structured input of diagnosis codes/terms to specify the key
            condition of interest). The clinician would then be able to accept the alert and add the
            problem, override the alert, or ignore it entirely. The investigators conducted a
            randomized trial and evaluated the effect of the problem list alert on three endpoints:
            alert acceptance, problem list addition rate and clinical quality. </para>
        <para>In IQ-MAPLE, a team of clinical experts and informaticians designed and validated a
            series of problem inference algorithms, using rules-based techniques on structured data
            in the EHR and natural language processing on unstructured data. Then, they created CDS
            rules for suggesting conditions to add to a patient’s problem list that may have included:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>queries for the presence or absence of a diagnosis code (e.g., ICD-10CM,
                        SNOMED CT® value sets by key condition) included in a patient’s problem list
                        or encounter diagnosis.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>queries looking for currently active medications (e.g., RXCUI value sets

            </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>Even though the CDS rules and value sets in the IQ-MAPLE study were created centrally,
            there would have inevitably been variation in the implementations of the rules against
            clinical data at the four study sites. A report produced out of the collaboration
            between the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)
            and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) stated that there are at least four important
            technical challenges to sharing and therefore standardizing implementations of CDS
            content: (1) insufficient standardization of patient data representation; (2)
            insufficient standardization of CDS knowledge representation; (3) insufficient
            standardization of CDS integration mechanisms; and (4) a need to align with broader
            standardization initiatives. [13]  </para>
        <para>Fundamentally, the representation and usage of clinical data and CDS knowledge across
            the four IQ-MAPLE study sites would have varied. One of the reasons that CDS
            interventions are difficult to implement between health care systems is because
            different EHR systems and health care systems utilize different underlying patient data
            models and CDS integration mechanisms. Even different instantiations of use of the same
            EHR systems differ in how they represent patient data. The ONC and NAM report stated
            that "[b]ecause CDS relies on inferencing using patient data, this heterogeneity in
            patient data representation poses an immense obstacle to sharing CDS." [13] In IQ-MAPLE,
            there were likely vast variations in the EHR user interfaces for how clinical data was
            entered in problem lists, representation of lab results, status and recording of
            currently active medications, and other miscellaneous clinical data inputs in patients’
            encounter notes.</para>
        <para>In addition, there were likely variations in the usage of the value set and
            terminology content at the four study organizations. Therefore, there may have been
            discrepancies in how the CDS rules were triggered when they were deployed. For example,
            perhaps physicians at one of the study sites had been trained to use only diagnosis
            codes that align with Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) codes in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services's (CMS)
            risk-adjustment model. These physicians would not have used any other diagnosis codes
            that may have existed in the IQ-MAPLE authored value sets for the CDS alerts. The other
            three study sites may not have operationalized such specific workflows, thereby reducing
            the standard representation of the IQ-MAPLE CDS alert implementations between the
            different medical centers. </para>
        <para>The following challenges plaguing CDS implementations were described in a report
            produced out of the collaboration between the ONC and the National Academy of Medicine.

                </listitem>
            </orderedlist>
        </para>
        <para>These challenges are due in part – according to the summary of Kawamoto's commentary
            in the ONC and NAM report – to a lack of clear standards for CDS content representation:
            "standards are not always defined clearly enough, so a developer will make a decision
            that enables content to work within [test] systems...but are not scalable nationally."
                    [13]<citation><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis></citation>Consequently, there
            are vendor-specific solutions and organization-specific solutions that exist with
            "either a laborious configuration of external licensed content or a laborious
            reinvention of the wheel as the organization creates its own content." [13] Instead of
            creating a knowledge representation based on a standardized clinical data
            representation, current efforts are focused on creating and re-creating one-off
            "solutions". Even the latest CDS content standards, including Clinical Quality Language
            (CQL), CDS Hooks, and OpenCDS have yet to achieve "the necessary level of detail in the
            standards and how they are applied to clinical decisions." [13]   </para>
        <para>Therefore, one of the overarching challenges of standards that aim to make CDS
            shareable and interoperable is that there is currently not a robust way to associate
            rules in knowledge-based systems with other dependencies in clinical data representation
            systems to ensure proper operation. Current CDS standards are silent on the notion of
            identifying a safe configuration of dependencies between (a) the expression-logic for
            rules-based CDS techniques, (b) the value sets with codes and terms to define clinical
            concepts of interest contained in the CDS rules, and (c) the variability of how clinical
            data within the value sets and rules are inputted, modeled, and stored in data
            repositories. </para>
        <para>These challenges have been explored by Wright et al when they studied CDS
            functionality at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and illustrated ways in which clinical
            decision support systems malfunction and identified patterns of such malfunctions. [14]
            As a part of this study, a survey of 29 Chief Medical Information Officers (CMIOs)
            showed that 93% of CMIOs experience CDS system malfunctions, and two-thirds experienced
            the malfunctions at least annually. <itemizedlist>

                        example, “an alert for monitoring thyroid function in patients receiving
                        amiodarone stopped working when an internal identifier for amiodarone was
                        changed in another system.” [14]  </para>

                Considerations</emphasis></title>
        <para>As described above, Wright et al learned that Brigham and Women’s Hospital did not
            have a system to track the siloed components of their EHR and CDS systems, nor did they
            have a process for tracking changes to the CDS rules, logic, and terminology
            implementations that were tied to other dependencies upstream or downstream in the
            implementation and process flow. Therefore, in IQ-MAPLE, the investigators tried to keep
            a closer eye on the design and functionality of CDS tools, including the background work
            required to update and maintain these complex systems.</para>
        <para>To test the validity of their IQ-MAPLE CDS alert implementations, each study site
            organization might have built a testing environment to implement the CDS rules to detect
            whether each suggestion of a condition to add to a patient’s problem list was
            “appropriate” or not. Such a testing environment would
            <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190717T112906-0600" comment="The first sentence says &quot;might have built a testing environment.&quot;  Thus, should this say &quot;might allow&quot; or &quot;would allow&quot; instead?  Need to ensure the tense agrees in the paragraphs in this section." flag="done"?>allow<?oxy_comment_end?>
            the CDS alerts to “silently” fire after they were built. In other words, the alerts were
            built and set to fire on patients in the back-end of the systems. End-users would NOT
            receive alerts at this stage. The alerts would “silently” fire for two weeks or some
            other agreed upon trial period. Then, the implementers would generate the list of
            patients for whom the silent alerts fire. </para>
        <para>Next, basic face-validity would be performed upon perusal of the patient lists for
            whom the alerts silently fired. For a condition with a high prevalence like
            hypertension, an implementer may not be surprised to see hundreds of alerts firing in a
            2-week span in their hospital, clinic, or medical center. Conversely, if the condition
            for a problem-list suggestion CDS rule is rarer, such as Sickle Cell Disease, then it
            would not be surprising to only see a handful of alerts fired in a 2-week silent run. If
            implementers thought that the count of alerts seemed off based on condition prevalence,
            then this could inform an analysis of the alert implementation and/or rules without
            having to do a more time-consuming chart-audit. </para>
        <para>Next, patient charts for whom the alerts silently fire were abstracted to validate
            that the alerts fired on appropriate people. In this step, it may suffice to validate a
            smaller subset of patient records rather than validating hundreds of patient charts for
            whom alerts may silently fire. If the alerts were accurate at some threshold (e.g., 90%)
            based on the chart audit, then the alert could be marked as “appropriate” at a given
            institution. If inaccuracies arise in the chart audit during the silent firing testing
            phase, it may reveal errors in the implementation, or in the rules themselves prior to
            go-live deployment. </para>
        <para>This sort of CDS testing environment would also allow for intra-organizational
            comparison of value set implementations or to assess the impact of inter-organizational
            updates to standard clinical terminologies over time. It could also be used to detect
            changes to CDS expression logic or rule changes and study the impact on the clinical
            data prior to deployment to better understand the impact of proposed updates. </para>

            <title>Metrics for Monitoring CDS Implementations before and after Go-Live
                Deployment</title>
            <para>This section will describe quality metrics for monitoring CDS performance. The ONC
                and NAM report highlighted the impetus for measuring whether CDS interventions are
                working: “ To optimize CDS and increase adoption and acceptance, it will be critical
                to determine which interventions are firing at the appropriate times and are then
                accepted by the clinical care team and patients and changing care for the better.
                This capability will be important at both the local and national scale if the goal
                is to reduce the burden on providers and health systems to each identify important
                lessons on their own." The following table shows examples of measures to determine
                the impact of CDS interventions. [14]   <table frame="all">

                <para>A CDS malfunction (aka true positive anomaly) occurs when the CDS rule does
                    not function as it was designed or expected to. The question that an evaluator

        <title>Historical Context for Representing the Expression Logic of Clinical Decision
            Support</title>
        <para>While there have been advancements over the past few decades in implementing clinical
            data standards (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®), there is still room to improve portability of
            CDS implementations across healthcare organizations. Different health care institutions
            may increasingly have their clinical data encoded according to standards-based
            terminologies, but each site will still require human intervention and hand-crafted
            implementations of computerized CDS, including patient safety alerts and health
            maintenance reminders intended to improve population health. One implementation of a CDS
            alert at a given institution is not completely transferrable to another institution,
            even if the organization is using the same Health IT system. Analysts at each
            organization will have to modify the underlying query so that it is computable against
            their respective clinical database structure. Furthermore, not all clinical concepts are
            recorded and stored in the same way in different EHR implementations; what may be
            structured in one system may be free text in another. While the Health Quality Measure
            Format (HQMF), Quality Data Model (QDM), and Clinical Quality Langauge (CQL) are the
            more recent efforts to improve standard representations of CDS expression logic, efforts
            date back to the mid 1970’s when early implementers of computer-based clinical
            information systems were first recognizing the value of computer-based decision support
            into their designs. </para>
        <para>Notably, Clem McDonald’s work on the Regenstrief Medical Record System exemplifies
            important early work in pseudocode logic expression. McDonald realized that the number
            of CDS reminders and alerts would quickly increase, so rather than hand-crafting each
            rule into computer code with programmers, he created one of the first CDS rule languages
            called CARE. [19] The CARE language allowed clinical experts and those without
            programming expertise to structure if-then logic alerts using a flexible scripting
            language that could be interpreted by programmers to implement against the patient
            record system. As computerized EHRs continued to spread to other academic medical
            centers in the years that followed, it became clear that a standard way to replicate the
            expression logic of CARE-style if-then decision rules would be needed. In the late
            1980s, informaticists at Columbia led an important initiative to standardize CDS
            scripting language and created the Arden Syntax or Medical Logic Modules, the goal of
            which was to encode if-then-else rules in a standard format that could be computed
            against different EHR systems, regardless of the location or specific vendor. Arden
            Syntax logic modules were novel in that they consisted of standard sections called
            ‘categories’, and each category contained several ‘slots’. For instance, the ‘logic’
            slot contained the actual clinical logic of a rule, and the ‘action’ slot defined the
            message that the rule would display to the clinician-user. Modern EHRs often still use
            this framework even if the full Arden Syntax is not used: when a clinician’s workflow
            reaches a trigger point, then a rule in the system is fired, and evaluates the clinical
            logic attached to the trigger point. [19] </para>
        <para>By the mid 1990’s, CDS rules using the Arden Syntax began to spread to numerous
            commercial systems, however dissemination was limited in that rules written in one
            facility would not run against any other system. While the ‘logic’ slot contained
            machine-executable if-then-else code, there was also a ‘curly brace’ part of the syntax
            that only contained a human-readable textual description of the database process and
            actions necessary for the rule to access clinical data in the EHR. This required
            human-interpretation and hand-crafting at each specific site and this challenge was
            referred to as the “curly brace problem”. [19] This challenge to achieve portability
            across environments has persisted throughout the 1990s to 2000s to the current day.
            These challenges were only worsened when guideline-based techniques were introduced
            attempting to separate clinical problems into a series of linked clinical decisions.
            There were some notable efforts such as Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF), PROforma,
            SAGE, and GEM, which aimed to incorporate a guideline’s logic into the executable part
            of decision logic, however these languages suffered due to a lack of maturity of
            standards to integrate the guideline engines into EHRs directly.
                [19]<citation> </citation></para>
        <para>In 1998, HL7 found the “curly brace” problem to be unsolvable by the Arden approach
            and began efforts to create expression logic standards based on HL7 Version 3 Reference
            Information Model (RIM). One attempt was the GELLO Expression Language, which in theory
            was supposed to access and manipulate clinical data by common clinical entities; however
            RIM was not proven to be a very practical representation of the complexity of real-world
            data. Only a small number of vendors were successfully able to implement RIM-based EHRs
            and therefore the vision of GELLO and HL7 V3 efforts remained unproven. In 2013, HL7
            replaced GELLO with “Event, Condition, Action” (ECA), an expression in XML data
            structures intended to abstract the representation of expression logic. Shortly
            thereafter, the standards community realized the benefit in aligning CDS logic
            expression with those of eCQMs, as the goals of CDS rules are often used to prompt

            Quality Improvement and Clinical Knowledge model (QUICK). QUICK and ECA have now been
            wrapped up into the Clinical Quality Language (CQL), which attempts to capture lessons

        <para>An emerging HL7 International standard that might help with electronic processing of
            eCQM and CDS logic is CQL, a new specification that focuses on a common model for
            representing expression logic for CQMs and Clinical Decision Support. According to CMS’
            eCQI Resource Center, CQL will be used in all quality measure specifications in the
            future, will replace the Quality Data Model (QDM), and is intended to reduce the burden
            on implementers for consuming measure artifacts. CQL representations of eCQMs will
            replace the QDM pseudocode historically published in HQMF files; it aims to provide a
            human-readable, conceptual-level language to define eCQMs and clinical decision support
            independent of specific data models, such as the QDM or FHIR (Fast Healthcare
            Interoperability Resource). </para>
        <para>CMS is rapidly rolling out the CQL standard in its eCQMs and CDS for the 2019
            reporting year. The goal of CQL moving forward is to use emerging Application

            <para>Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) "are a specific set of practices that are
                required to be initiated and followed when specific circumstances arise. In clinical
                care, clinicians have historically been familiar with SOPs in specific types of
                restricted contexts. For example, emergency room physicians have SOPs for patients
                who are brought in an unconscious state; nurses in an operating theater have SOPs
                for the forceps and swabs that they hand over to the operating surgeons; and
                laboratory technicians have SOPs for handling, testing, and subsequently discarding
                body fluids obtained from patients."</para>
            <para>Now that EHRs and electronic clinical data in some capacity are essentially
                ubiquitous in the United States, Health IT implementations often come with tools
                making it possible to achieve SOPs "into routine clinical practice; that is, not for
                special patients (e.g. those who are unconscious) or for special circumstances (e.g.
                clinical trials), but for every patient in everyday clinical care."SOP</para>

                Practice <?oxy_comment_end?>Guidelines</title>
            <para>Clinical Practice Guidelines are systematically developed statements on medical
                practices that assist a clinician in making decisions about appropriate diagnostic
                and therapeutic healthcare services for specific medical conditions. These
                guidelines should be evidence-based and use research evidence along with clinical
                expertise and patient preferences in providing care. Guidelines are usually
                developed by authoritative professional societies and organizations. Guidelines
                provide clinicians and patients the recommendations for screening, diagnostic and
                therapeutic actions that are known or believed to favorably affect the health
                outcomes of patients. Guidelines are not meant to replace the clinical judgement of
                the individual provider or establish a standard of care. They are meant to be
                flexible and are only considered as recommendations. Where Guidelines are meant to
                be flexible, standards are a rigid set of criteria, meant to be followed under any
                circumstances. [21] </para>

                <para>The Society of Nuclear Medicine &amp; Molecular Imaging in collaboration with
                    other professional society creates and hosts 'Procedure Standards' for a variety

                    research procedures. [22]  </para>
                <para>Similarly, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) develops
                    evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which serve as a framework
                    for clinical decisions and supporting best practices. Clinical practice
                    guidelines are statements that include recommendations intended to optimize
                    patient care. They are informed by a systematic review of evidence, and an
                    assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. CPGs should
                    follow a sound, transparent methodology to translate best evidence into clinical
                    practice for improved patient outcomes. Additionally, evidence-based CPGs are a
