    <title>Ethical Consideration</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction to Ethical Imperatives</title>
        <para>Ethics are individual or shared moral principles that govern our behavior and set standards for what is considered right or wrong. These moral principles can be applied to any component of human behavior, including personal, social, and economic or business decisions. Many organizations and businesses have internal ethical codes and guidelines for employees to follow when working , including medical and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs). [1]
            As our team continues efforts towards Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) and a contributed IKM application, it is critical that our work improves the interoperability and quality of healthcare data to support medical professionals and patients with ethical considerations.

        <title>Medical Ethics</title>
        <para>The medical field is driven by a strong code of Medical Ethics, or bioethics, that
            guide providers through their daily practice, decision making, and issues related to
            patient care. There are four pillars of medical ethics that guide providers as they
            determine the best course of action for patient care:</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>Justice (ensuring fairness) <para>[2]</para></para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Unlike other fields, medical providers and other professionals involved in patient
            care are often faced with moral decisions that have unique consequences for not only
            patients, but also for the patient’s family, communities, and even themselves. The
            Hippocratic Oath may come to mind when thinking about ethics in patient care. This
                5<superscript>th</superscript> century Code of Ethics advanced the idea of relieving
            patient suffering and promoting well-being through patient-physician relationship and
            still guides providers today. The American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics
            is another ethical guide for providers that was adopted in 1847; this code explains the
            standards of ethical conduct for physicians, patients, and the entire medical
            profession/society. The current Code has greatly expanded since 1847 and offers general
            rules of practice as well as providing tools for physicians facing novel ethical
            questions. [3]</para>
        <para>Patient care providers are not the only medical professionals that encounter scenarios
            that raise ethical questions surrounding the care they provide, professionals involved
            in medical research also face ethical dilemmas, like which patients qualify for
            experimental treatments. The medical community created institutional review boards to
            address ethics in research and develop guidelines and solutions for these
            questions.</para>

        <title>The Impact of Healthcare Terminologies on Ethics</title>
        <para>An ongoing and developing conversation in medical ethics is the proper use of health
            data. Genomics is an example of a data source that produces large volumes of health
            data. The field of Genomics uses whole genome or whole exome sequencing extracted from
            biological specimens to study genetically linked diseases, population wide health, and
            rare or neglected diseases. However, while this data offers researchers quality insight,
            the use of this data opens the door to questions about patient consent, data storage and
            future use, and breaches in patient privacy. To manage, codify, and communicate the
            large amounts of health data they collect, healthcare organizations use healthcare
            terminology standards like Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms© (SNOMED
            CT©), Logical Observations Identifiers Names and Codes© (LOINC©), and National Library
            of Medicine’s codification of the U.S. pharmacopeia (RxNorm) developed by SDOs. Although
            SDOs continuously improve their codes, many terminology standards lack interoperability
            between the standards themselves and the organizations that use them, which can impact
            patient safety and the quality of care. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Ethical Implications for Providers</title>
        <para>Beyond facilitating communication, healthcare terminology standards play a crucial
            role in medical ethics. In an environment where every decision holds weight, these
            terminologies work to ensure that healthcare professionals share a common understanding
            of patient data so that providers can translate information into actionable insights and
            improved patient outcomes. Making informed decisions is a critical component of a
            medical professional’s ethical responsibility. Electing for a given treatment option
            without understanding critical factors like existing health conditions, medical history,
            or other pertinent information can have both ethical and qualitative impacts on patient
            care. As efforts continue towards successful IKM, data must be seamlessly exchanged
            within and between systems, while maintaining meaning and accuracy, to prevent
            misunderstandings and errors and fulfill a provider’s ethical duty to “do good” and “do
            no harm”.</para>
        <para>Furthermore, these terminologies play a role in addressing challenges related to
            health equity, including fairness and accessibility in healthcare. Terminology standards
            provide a normalized and repeatable way to classify conditions, treatments, and various
            other aspects of patient care. As we work to improve the interoperability and accuracy
            of transmitted data through IKM, researchers and providers will more easily be able to
            identify and address discrepancies in healthcare. Standardized terminologies are
            instrumental in dismantling barriers that stem from linguistic, cultural, or systemic
            differences by providing a universal language for health conditions and treatments to
            support consistent care, irrespective of a patient or provider's background or
            geographic location. Healthcare terminologies promote a shared understanding of
            conditions and treatments across groups of people, reducing disparities in healthcare
            delivery. Standardized terminologies benefit clinicians in the same way by providing
            them with an unbiased language to navigate the world of clinical decision making and
            potential ethical dilemmas. [4]</para>

    <section>
        <title>Ethical Implications for Patients</title>
        <para>The ethical implications of patient comprehension are profound. In scenarios where
            treatment options are complex or risky, the ability of patients to understand and weigh
            these options is critical. Healthcare terminologies work to convey information in a
            consistent and clear manner, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings that could
            impact patient decisions [4,5,6]. These terminologies serve as key facilitators in
            enhancing patient communication and autonomy. By providing a clear and consistent
            language for health information, they empower patients to understand their health
            better, participate actively in their care, and make informed choices – all fundamental
            to ethical and patient-centered healthcare.</para>
        <para>Ethical patient care, including informed patient decision making, must remain a
            driving force behind IKM. Ensuring that data, clinical concepts, and terminologies are
            standardized and interoperable between and within systems like EHRs, patient portals and
            educational materials can lead to improved patient comprehension, better self-management
            of conditions, reduced hospital readmissions, and the ability for patients to ultimately
            choose their care. [5]</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>Ethical considerations must remain a driving force behind the development,
            implementation, and adoption of IKM. IKM must support providers and patients as they
            navigate existing ethical dilemmas, while balancing the ethical concerns surrounding
            patient data, personally identifiable information, and personal health information use
            and storage. IKM will also need to rapidly integrate with new technologies to address
            ethical considerations, particularly around privacy and consent, as artificial
            intelligence, machine learning, and other technologies become more prominent in the
            healthcare ecosystem.</para>
