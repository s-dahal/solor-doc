        <title>Introduction to Wisdom of Crowds</title>
        <para>It is important to recognize the general impact of open and transparent collaboration
            across our Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) efforts and the healthcare ecosystem.
            One framework for collaboration is crowdsourcing, which solicits feedback from large
            groups to develop ideas, products, or services through online communities and allows
            people to share their thoughts voluntarily and asynchronously without a formal
            arrangement. This phenomenon has helped encourage both individual and group
            contributions to drive IKM efforts and development. Crowdsourcing, in part, relies on
            the Wisdom of Crowds, which refers to the collective intelligence and decision-making
            ability of a diverse group, often leading to more accurate outcomes than individual
            decisions. In healthcare, this concept has been applied in various ways, from diagnosing
            rare diseases through crowdsourcing to improving clinical care by harnessing structured
            information-sharing networks among physicians. [1] [2] The collective insight of
            healthcare professionals, patients, and the public can significantly enhance diagnostic
            accuracy, treatment plans, and healthcare innovation.</para>
        <para>This section explores one of the latest healthcare Information Technology (IT) trends
            in decision-making to improve the quality and interoperability of data as they are
            managed, stored, and exchanged across systems. The integration of the Wisdom of Crowds
            with IKM and TermINology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) presents a promising avenue for
            advancing healthcare knowledge management. By leveraging collective intelligence,
            healthcare systems can become more adaptive, responsive, and effective in meeting the
            needs of patients and healthcare professionals.</para>

        <title>Open Source Overview</title>
        <para>Crowdsourcing is based on an open framework for contributions called open-source.
            <?oxy_comment_start author="rgeorgacopoulos" timestamp="20240712T152054-0500" comment="from open-source.xml"?>Open-source
            software makes its source code, blueprints, documentation, and other products publicly
            available for users to modify, contribute to, and distribute. Open-source software uses
            a decentralized approach to software development that supports open collaboration,
            testing, and improvements from the community of users. In open-source, no one group is
            solely responsible for maintaining or improving software because peer-to-peer production
            of code and documentation is encouraged. While a governing body may exist in practice to
            maintain the software and ensure contributions meet community guidelines, they may not
            hold special rights to the software. Reasonable guidelines, such as extensive
            documentation procedures, enhance the benefits and trust in open-source solutions, while
            simultaneously preventing an “anything goes” mentality.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>
        <para>The current restrictive and proprietary nature of software licensing within the
            healthcare ecosystem significantly hinders interoperability, particularly by preventing
            or restricting community engagement and contributions that could improve the software or
            code to meet emerging needs. To achieve lossless data exchanges between and within
            systems, the Health IT community must consider open-source software and open-source
            licensing models. While these licenses enable use, regardless of intent, and the ability
            to modify, adapt, and extend software with minimal restrictions, they also establish
            rules of the road and codify best practices to ensure adoptability and ease of use for
            both the initial user and the broader downstream community. Open-source licensing will
            support the public-private consortium needed to address gaps created by varying rates of
            adoption and implementation of proprietary software.</para>
        <para>Due to the decentralization and wide-spread availability of open-source software,
            errors and bugs are found much quicker because the code is utilized in a variety of
            contexts and stretched much farther. Instead of a single development team being tasked
            with identifying and repairing errors, users can serve as developers and contribute to
            addressing errors much faster. As a result, open-source software employs a high degree
            of modularity where it can be adaptive and flexible to the diverse needs of its
            users.</para>
        <para>Allowing for open licensing encourages improvements to terminology and standards by
            ancillary bodies. The open licensing also creates a more robust and flexible system that
            can adapt to the varying needs of organizations.</para>
        <para>Open-source software is preferred and is managed through open-source licensing. A
            permissive license will provide source code to users, carries minimal restriction over
            adaption, modification, and distribution of intellectual property of organizations, and
            allows the issuing body to impose some restrictions, such as monetization. However, the
            permissive license does not exert special rights to derivative works. Permissive
            licensing throughout the foundational architecture, terminology knowledge, and statement
            model layers removes barriers imposed on modifications and extensions and improves the
            compatibility of different terminologies to support a common understanding of knowledge. </para>
        <para>Below we expand upon the open-source concept to explore crowdsourcing IKM principles.

        <title>Background</title>
        <para>In 2006, Jeff Howe from WIRED magazine coined the term “crowdsourcing” and published
            the book “<emphasis role="italic">Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd is Driving
                the Future of Business</emphasis>” that provided an in-depth reflection on the
            phenomenon of massive online collaboration. [1] He further explained that crowdsourcing
            originated from large corporations where a handful of computer programmers formed a
            community of like-minded peers who demonstrated they could create more competitive
            products. Crowdsourcing, a behavior of collecting information and collaborating ideas
            through online tools, has a long history dating back to Aristotle who states, “It is
            possible that the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come together
            may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are so, just as public
            dinners to which many contribute are better than those supplied at one man’s cost,” in
                <emphasis role="italic">Politics</emphasis>. [3] </para>
        <para>Dr. Damon Centola, Professor of Communication, Sociology, and Engineering, at
            Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, explores
            crowdsourcing in healthcare and notes how physicians who use the right apps and network
            with other physicians are more likely to revise their recommendations after each round
            and improve their diagnostic reasoning. He also reports that providers who use
            technology diagnose and order treatments more accurately. [1] Technology has not only
            been a great catalyst to improve communication but has also positioned stakeholders to
            more efficiently share their ideas, gather information, and identify best practices
            across various scenarios, ultimately leading to improved care. </para>
        <para>The conversation surrounding crowdsourcing then led to another phenomenon called, The
            Wisdom of Crowds, when James Surowiecki, an American journalist, coined the term to
            describe the characteristics of crowdsourcing. His book examines how large groups have
            made superior decisions in biology, pop culture, behavioral economic, psychology, and
            other fields compared to individual experts. [4]</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>What is the Impact of Wisdom of Crowds on Healthcare?</title>
        <para>Precious Porter, RN, BSN, introduces the Netflix documentary series “Diagnosis” in her
            article “Crowdsourcing: Using the wisdom of the crowd in health care”. [5] Dr. Lisa
            Sander treated patients with mysterious illnesses and helped them find a support group
            via the internet. The “crowd” consisted of medical doctors, psychologists, caregivers,
            patients, and readers from all over the world. The collective knowledge from these
            stakeholders provided direction for treatment options and, most importantly, kindled the
            source of shared hope to bring a sense of humanity during difficult times. </para>
        <para>Another example of the impact of Crowdsourcing or Wisdom of Crowds is the COVID-19
            pandemic. Crowdsourcing was used to track the development and availability of COVID-19
            vaccines all around the world and facilitated the 3D-printing of medical supplies, such
            as protective gear, masks, face shields, and mechanical ventilators, for healthcare
            organizations in need of supplies during the crisis. [1]</para>
        <para>The healthcare community consists of many different stakeholders, including medical
            providers, IT professionals, informaticists, researchers, marketers, project conveners
            who bring commercial, public and private stakeholders together, and more. Employing the
            Wisdom of Crowds in healthcare offers a diverse array of perspectives and information
            that can facilitate rapid and adaptable solution development. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>How can we Apply Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of Crowds to IKM and Tinkar?</title>
        <para>Several areas of IKM can benefit from crowdsourcing knowledge and embracing the
            widespread concept of the Wisdom of Crowds. First, by deploying an open-source approach
            to the development of a contributed IKM application and sharing details of Tinkar
            development, including current challenges or issues, the Wisdom of Crowds can generate
            potential solutions and enhance IKM processes. Second, by engaging with stakeholders,
            the crowd can identify solutions to support and maintain high quality and interoperable
            data across medical scenarios. Engaging with the diverse stakeholders across the
            healthcare ecosystem will generate solutions for a wide range of scenarios and lessons
            learned that will inform continuous improvement. </para>
        <para>The main purpose of Tinkar is to standardize the representation of disparate
            healthcare terminology standards used by healthcare professionals in various roles.
            Gathering public feedback from stakeholders and professionals in different areas of
            healthcare who are busy and cannot be together in one place at the same time provides an
            avenue to contribute their invaluable expertise and experience in a free and open forum. </para>
        <para>Crowdsourcing is open ideation and aims to not impede existing internal practices and
            processes. Instead, the integration of crowdsourcing aims to align with the overall
            strategy and provide value for the existing IKM community or organizations that are
            dedicated to developing any aspect of IKM. Developing a clear plan can help maximize the
            use of crowdsourcing and helps crowdsourcing users to stay within defined goals and
            boundaries. While IKM is taking an open-source approach to its development, some areas
            need continued improvement. Wisdom of Crowds and crowdsourcing could contribute to
            addressing the following challenges in the healthcare ecosystem:</para>

            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>By clearly defining areas that need improvement, our team will be able to focus the
            Wisdom of Crowds to support improvements in the areas identified for development. Below
            are a few examples of innovative approaches in healthcare knowledge management and
            decision-making.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Enhancing IKM with Crowdsourced Insights</emphasis>: The
            integration of crowdsourced insights into IKM systems can significantly enhance
            healthcare data management. For instance, in the context of obesity and cancer research,
            crowdsourcing has been used to improve the quality of knowledge bases by incorporating
            public contributions into the information extraction process. [6] This approach can be
            extended to other areas in healthcare, where public input can provide valuable insights
            and fill gaps in existing knowledge.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Case Study: OC-2-KB System</emphasis>: The Obesity and Cancer to
            Knowledge Base (OC-2-KB) system is an example of integrating crowdsourcing into
            healthcare knowledge management. This system uses natural language processing and
            machine learning techniques to extract semantic triples from PubMed abstracts related to
            obesity and cancer. Crowdsourcing is then employed to refine the extracted facts,
            enhancing the quality and reliability of the information in the knowledge base.
            [6]</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Tinkar Enhanced by Real-Time, Crowdsourced Healthcare
                Data</emphasis>: Tinkar's role in standardizing healthcare terminology can be
            augmented by incorporating real-time, crowdsourced healthcare data. This approach can
            ensure that the terminology used in healthcare systems remains up-to-date and reflective
            of current clinical practices and patient experiences. For example, crowdsourced
            contributions can help identify emerging medical terms and concepts, which can then be
            integrated into Tinkar's repository, ensuring its relevance and applicability.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Hypothetical Scenario: Emergency Response</emphasis>: In an
            emergency response scenario, such as a pandemic, the combination of crowdsourced data,
            IKM, and Tinkar can be particularly effective. Real-time data from healthcare
            professionals and the public can be gathered and integrated into IKM systems, providing
            a comprehensive view of the situation. Tinkar can ensure that the terminology used in
            this data is standardized, facilitating effective communication and decision-making
            across different healthcare systems and regions.</para>
        <para>While the synergy between these elements offers significant potential, there are
            challenges, that we will discuss alter in this section, to consider, including ensuring
            the accuracy and reliability of crowdsourced data, maintaining privacy and security, and
            effectively integrating this data into existing healthcare IT systems.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Is Crowdsourcing Reliable?</title>
        <para>The Wisdom of Crowds in healthcare offers several advantages, including diverse
            perspectives, rapid information gathering, and innovative problem-solving. [6] However,
            the approach also has limitations of potential misinformation, anonymity, unchecked
            credentials, breaches that compromise intellectual property, and identity theft.
            Additionally, a framework to review ideas generated from Wisdom of Crowds by established
            Subject Matter Experts will ensure contributions are impactful, meet quality assurance
            standards, and are feasible. Relevant stakeholders will need to address these risks to
            govern the wisdom of the crowds under a better set of legitimate policy and regulations
            for virtual exchanges. </para>
        <para>As we continue to refine IKM efforts and incorporate crowdsourced and Wisdom of Crowds
            contributions, our team will build upon the lessons learned and best practices from
            other efforts in this space. The following recommendations will support any healthcare
            organizations with a strong interest in obtaining high-quality contributions through
            crowdsourcing. </para>
        <para>1.<emphasis role="bold"> Develop robust frameworks</emphasis>. Robust frameworks must
            effectively leverage collective intelligence for gathering, integrating, and analyzing
            crowd sourced information in order to maintain the accuracy and reliability of obtained
            information from the public. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">2. Keep ethical considerations and privacy
                concerns</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">. </emphasis>As addressed in other volumes,
            while crowdsourcing offers unique advantages, a simultaneous priority must be to protect
            patient data and ensure ethical use of crowdsourced information. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">3. Encourage any opportunity of global exchange or collaboration
                for crowdsourcing. </emphasis>The future of healthcare is one step closer to being

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>As we continue to refine IKM we will explore the integration of crowdsourcing with
            healthcare knowledge management systems and highlight its potential to transform
            healthcare delivery and decision-making. The synergy between collective intelligence and
            healthcare knowledge management systems presents a promising avenue for advancing
            healthcare. By leveraging the Wisdom of Crowds, healthcare organizations can improve
            decision-making processes, enhance data quality, and achieve greater interoperability in
            healthcare systems. The future of healthcare looks promising with the integration of
            emerging technologies and innovative approaches, paving the way for a more efficient,
            effective, and patient-centered healthcare ecosystem.</para>

        <title>The Current State of Healthcare Knowledge Management</title>
        <para>Over the last decade, billion dollars have been poured into achieving interoperability
            in the healthcare industry. Patients, providers, and healthcare agencies have
            collectively identified the need for a more harmonized, integrated health system to
            solve the challenges surrounding clinical data, such as its interpretability and
            accuracy. The current structure of the healthcare ecosystem continues to fail in
            providing adequate structures conducive to collaborative, community-based solutioning. A
            review in 2021 of American Hospital Association Information Technology survey data found
            that by 2018, 98.3% of hospitals have adopted Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems –
            the primary creators and curators of digital health data. Yet, across the board, health
            systems have struggled to move beyond simple adoption and implement advanced use in
            patient engagement and clinical data analytics. [1] Notably, critical access hospitals
            in rural areas were less likely to demonstrate advanced usage with an expanding deficit
            to their counterparts in clinical data analytics since 2015, leading to gaps in patient
            access of quality healthcare. </para>
        <para>Today, many hospital systems have the goal of improving data interoperability within
            and beyond their system. To be truly useful, clinical data must move through numerous
            systems without loss of meaning. In an idealized situation, data transfers would
            complete a single round-trip with total integrity intact. In reality, only 22% - 68% of
            data integrity is successfully preserved through its transfer journey. [2] A patient’s
            record may correctly showcase the correct numerical result from a test but could lose
            the context and meaning surrounding the test. Ever-increasing system complexity and
            resulting low-quality data, however, has ultimately impacted the quality of care across
            the healthcare ecosystem, such as inefficiencies of redundant testing and procedures
            being ordered, expanding the time frame of care for patients. Additionally, the very
            systems that have been designed to integrate EHRs into the health space can create
            barriers to interoperability through closed, proprietary systems. Multiple, sometimes
            competing, encoding standards have been developed over the last few decades to address
            the varying formats clinical data embodies. Some clinical standardization forms,
            however, are very broad in its acceptance criteria resulting in large amounts of
            variation between encodement while others are too restrictive, limiting the situations
            in which they can be utilized. As a result, the need for a consistent form to map
            standards to and between other standards in creation of a common model is required for
            improvement of interoperability within the healthcare landscape where clinical decisions
            can be captured regardless of what point they originate in patient care.

            <title>Defining a Key Issue: Restrictive Healthcare Licenses</title>
            <para>The root cause of insufficiencies within Health IT is not limited solely to a
                group of vendors or organizations but is rather a foundational issue that permeates
                throughout the ecosystem. Restrictive licenses are just one of these causes and are
                used in varying forms across the landscape. However, this spurs unintended
                consequences of limiting harmonization. Instead of just treating the symptomatic
                results of poor data quality, attention should also be spent understanding the
                reasons beneath recurring pain points. Various standards have been developed to
                compete and improve upon the limitations of other encoding standards. As multiple
                organizations, such as by clinicians, laboratorians, and providers integrate patient
                data together, the need of various standards to transfer openly and completely
                becomes even more apparent. A piecemeal approach has occurred where different
                standards carry licensing restrictions to protect against modifications and
                extensions of their code for proprietary oversight, creating confusion on how and to
                what extent standards can be shared. Healthcare data standard organizations seek to
                protect their software and standards, by design, from unauthorized subversion,
                modification, and duplication of their work through their licensing agreements.
                These restrictions often allow for direct oversight of derivative works from the
                issuing body as well as monetization from commercial usage of their product. In a
                highly profitable landscape, restrictive licenses allow organizations to prevent
                their work from being duplicated by rivals and seek longevity in the marketplace.
                Proprietary licensing leads to siloed operations by providers and developers, as
                well as higher implementation costs, limiting stronger adoption. These restrictive
                licenses can pose challenges on the ease of transfers within and between systems and
                are creators of insufficiencies within Health IT. For example, issuing standards do
                not always fit into the exact context practitioners need and require adaption into
                localized knowledge. Licenses often prevent against local knowledge being shared
                between system and require a mapping to an existing code for meaningful data usage.
                Data integrity can be impacted as there may be no exact match that encompasses all
                the information from local codes and be transferred incompletely. Tools to aid in
                standardization may be restricted due to modification and extension restrictions
                within proprietary licenses. </para>
            <para><emphasis>The current restrictive and proprietary nature of licensing within the
                    healthcare ecosystem significantly hinders interoperability. To achieve lossless
                    data exchanges between systems, the Health IT community must consider movement
                    towards open-source software and open-source licensing models.</emphasis> Gaps
                created by varying rates of adoption and implementation requires various avenues of
                collaboration within the IKM community to address these issues within the entire
                Health IT ecosystem. </para>

        <title>The Case for a More Open Future in Healthcare</title>
        <para>The rapid expansion of technology and connectivity has created ill-defined guidelines
            on management and ownership of data. As a result, researchers and users find themselves
            navigating different and competing guidance on utilizing and adapting software for their
            own needs. One of the main movements on expanding access and resolving conflict between
            proprietary systems is that of granting wide, sweeping rights through the open-source
            movement. Notably, open-source software like Mozilla Firefox has enabled web access
            utilized by millions every year. Additionally, open software systems, like Apache 2.0,
            have had broad adoptive use because it allows software to be used for any purpose,
            modified or otherwise. </para>
        <para>The following sections aim to define the open-source software and licensing more
            clearly: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Open-Source Software (OSS) </emphasis></para>
        <para>There are two branches of software utilized by individuals and companies: open-source
            software and proprietary, or closed-source, software. At the most theoretical level, in
            an open-source environment, the source code is freely available and accessible to its
            end-users regardless of their intent, be it for personal or commercial use. The term
            “free” is under debate regarding the cost of accessing the software and under contention
            on if the source code can be monetized for access. Here, free is used as in libre, or
            freedom, and not necessarily in cost. The discussion of free licensing extends to
            freedoms guaranteed through the licensing for the software, and not in the context of
            the monetary cost to access the software. Many software systems are considered to be
            open-source but are not free from implementation cost. There are third-party costs
            associated with integrating and maintaining open-source. </para>
        <para>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) defines free as in: </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom

                <para>The freedom to study how the program works and alter it so it computes as you
                    wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</para>

                    3). [3] </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>This is controlled in the forms of licenses and is discussed further below. Closed
            source systems protect the source code and modifications cannot be made where the
            end-user can only execute the code within the confines of the original intent of the
            creator. </para>
        <para>In open-source, no one group is solely responsible for the software because it allows
            for a peer-to-peer production of codes and documentation. A governing body may exist to
            oversee and maintain the software as long as no one group holds special rights to the
            software. Due to the decentralization of software, errors and bugs are found much
            quicker because the code is utilized in a variety of contexts and stretched much
            farther. Instead of a single development team being tasked with identifying and
            repairing errors as they are found, users can also be developers and contribute to
            identifying errors much faster. As a result, open-source software utilizes a high degree
            of modularity where it can be adaptive and flexible to the diverse needs of its users. </para>
        <para><emphasis>In its purest form, open-source software lowers the burden of buy-in
                required by consumers where they can build on the work of others through a
                collaborative community without reinvention</emphasis>. Lower implementation cost
            and maintenance of open-source software helps expand the possible consumer base. It is
            not restricted to those who can devote the time and resources to stand up the required
            infrastructure and knowledge base. Instead, end-users can guide and shape the software
            to their niche rather than be limited to the specific intended usage at its inception.
            The creation of open-source leads to a symbiotic ecosystem where software is more robust
            and applicable than its closed counterparts. </para>
        <para>Many software systems today utilize qualities of open-source software but lie in a
            gray area where they maintain proprietary techniques. These limits are imposed by their
            licensing models through their end-user agreements. </para>

            <para>The GDPR has influenced data management and privacy practices in the healthcare
                sector by compelling healthcare organizations to adopt stricter data protection
                measures and transparency in data handling. According to GDPR law, health data is
                defined as personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural
                person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information
                about their health. This health data also includes genetic and biometric data.
                [5]</para>
            <para>Healthcare organizations must adapt to these strict new regulations, and are
                charged with managing patient consent, data portability, and the consequences of
                non-compliance, which could be fines up to €22M+. For U.S. healthcare organization
                this means complying with GDPR as well as Health Insurance Portability and
                Accountability Act (HIPPA), which is a separate level of consent and information the
                provider has to ensure the patient receives. Additionally, GDPR places the burden of
                proof of consent on the provider, and they must implement an audit trail for
                electronic consents. This example demonstrates how regulatory changes are shaping
                the future of data management in healthcare and aligns with the need for clarity in
                data management guidelines.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Open-Source Licensing (OSL) </emphasis></para>
            <para>The implementation of open-source software is managed in-hand through open-source
                licensing (OSL). The license of the software sets out the guidelines on the usage
                and implementation of the specific version of software being used. The license acts

            <para><emphasis role="bold">Public-Domain</emphasis>: Public domain refers to any
                information, software, or intellectual property that carries no restrictions in
                regard to copyright law. It is free to use by any individual. No one group can
                exercise control over it. In a software setting, source code must be provided. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Permissive License</emphasis>: Also known as an open-source
                license. This type of license carries minimal restriction over adaption,
                modification, and distribution of intellectual property of organizations. An issuing
                body may impose some restrictions, such as the monetization, but it does not exert
                special rights to derivative works. In a software setting, source code must be
                provided. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Protective License</emphasis>: This type of license, also
                called a copyleft license, grants rights on modification and redistribution but also
                requires derivative works to include and grants the same rights of the original
                license. Similar to public domain and permissive licenses, source code must also be
                accessible. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Noncommercial</emphasis>: The license only grants special
                rights to be used in a noncommercial setting where an external entity may exercise
                proprietary control or monetization of the applicable intellectual property. This
                can also decrease the cost of access, especially for organizations for academic or
                research purposes. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Proprietary</emphasis>: The most traditional form of
                licensing where no rights must be granted to other entities. There are varying
                significant restrictions on modification and distribution, where it is often
                disallowed completely. </para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Trade Secret</emphasis>: Often left unpublished, information
                is not open to the public or non-entity members in any form. It is the most
                restrictive, private type of licensing. In software, no source code is available. </para>
            <para>Open-source licensing is seen as a method to resolve the dispute between
                unauthorized copying and distribution of content as well as the copyright laws that
                have been created to protect individual and businesses of their own work. [6]
                Instead of users finding ways to circumvent barriers of access to content, the
                license serves as a pathway on how to freely access and modify software to the needs
                of users while protecting the proprietary interests of the originator. In this
                context, discussion surrounding the term of “free” applies here as well as in
                open-source software. Many software systems are considered to be open-source and
                utilize an open-source license but are not free in cost to the licensee. </para>
            <para>Open-source licensing agreements give access to software that may have been
                prevented under copyright law. These types of licenses enable use regardless of
                intent and the ability to modify, adapt, and extend software with minimal
                restrictions. The license establishes rules of the road and codifies best practices
                to enable adoptability and ease of use for both the initial user and the broader
                downstream community. For example, many licenses require modifications to be
                disclosed and thoroughly documented for third-party individuals to avoid
                endorsements and confusion regarding what has been published directly from
                organizations themselves. </para>
            <para>In practice, many licenses are not considered open-source due to certain
                conditions like distribution, access, and modification being prohibited. It is
                important to note that the quality of software and source code is not inherently
                affected by the structure of the license. A balance, however, is required ensuring
                that the licenses do not cause unintended consequences surrounding the proper
                development and evolution of the code by the user. [7] </para>

        <title>Examining License Agreements in Action</title>
        <para>For many organizations, it is unrealistic to fully adopt all parts of open-source
            software and licensing. Organization’s structure licenses dependent on the intended
            usage of software and codes and aim to embody qualities of open-source. For example, an
            individual may be able to access software and source code for no-cost or at a greatly
            reduced cost if it is meant for an academic usage. The moment where the user would like
            to adapt, transmute, and distribute software, they will often need a different license
            such as a commercial one. Rather than being purely open or closed source, in
            application, many organizations lie somewhere in the middle where commercialization of
            parts of their software support the ongoing research, development, and maintenance of
            itself. Organizations argue that the monetization of their software also allows them to
            create detailed guidance for implementation as well as more direct support to its
            customers while also protecting the proprietary source and implementation of its
            product.

        <title>Case-Study: LOINC® and SNOMED International Licensing
            Agreements</title>
        <para>Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Code® (LOINC®) and Systemized Nomenclature
            of Medicine – Clinical Terms® (SNOMED CT®) are two of the most widely used health data
            standards in the U.S. for clinical terminology. LOINC® is overseen by the Regenstrief
            Institute and utilizes a global team for maintaining, developing, and updating guidance
            on its terminology with the vision of promoting open terminology standards across every
            clinical information system [11]. LOINC® advocates for open terminology standards but
            does not issue an open-source license. Instead, all users are required to hold a license
            to utilize LOINC®, with some licenses requiring a fee to implement and utilize the full
            functionality of LOINC®. Similarly, SNOMED CT® is overseen by SNOMED International with
            the intent to support, maintain, and implement SNOMED CT®. All users are required to
            accept SNOMED International’s licensing agreement through an end-user agreement and are
            issued a proprietary license with some requiring a fee depending on the usage and intent
            of the license. Both organizations issue guidance on new and existing codes to reflect
            current events and needs at least biannually by engaging in a rigorous feedback function
            where users can engage. SNOMED International is moving towards more timely standard
            updates, not limited to the biannual timeline, especially for rapid developing arenas,
            such as COVID-19. </para>

            <title>Where Licenses Break Interoperability: Redistribution and Modification</title>
            <para>The Regenstrief institute highlights guiding principles such as openness and
                agility in improving and widening LOINC®’s implementation. Regenstrief does not
                allow the distribution of modified codes under their license. Often, health systems
                will adapt an existing code to better represent their localized environment where
                there is no one-for-one match. Users must create their own solution limited to the
                licensing agreement, engage in a feedback process with the Regenstrief Institute,
                and wait until a new code is issued directly from Regenstrief to be able to share
                between systems. </para>
            <para>SNOMED International does not allow for derivative work or extensions to be
                created if it has not already been issued a Namespace Identifier. Modifications are
                disallowed under their SNOMED CT® Affiliate license and must go through a feedback
                process where users can petition for added codes in a future release cycle. This is
                to avoid confusion and ambiguity of SNOMED International codes and prevent against
                inconsistencies between systems. [12] As a result, there will be many forms of
                similarly derived codes in a localized format. </para>
            <para>This waiting cycle creates gaps that directly impact the quality and
                interoperability of data. While organizations petition to have new codes created,
                they must continue to standardize their codes before their data is transferred to
                another system. During this step, data can be lost during the transfer from a local
                code to a standard LOINC® or SNOMED CT® code. Doctors may lose the much-needed
                context surrounding patient care, leading to redundancy in additional ordered tests
                and referrals. Moreover, the issuance of new codes does not circumvent the usage of
                localized knowledge. New codes can be used in place of local knowledge, but it can
                also be further adapted into knowledge for the specific needs of practitioners. This
                does not solve the transfer errors that can occur when local codes are standardized.

        <title>Putting a More Open Healthcare Ecosystem Into Practice</title>
        <para>The IKM community has been longing to address proper standardization encodement of
            healthcare information across ever changing system. Many avenues of collaboration would
            help solve the data quality and interoperability issue that the healthcare IT ecosystem
            is facing. The meaningful semantic difference within terminologies requires preservation
            to prevent against varying clinical interpretations and treatment. An <emphasis
                role="bold">IKM</emphasis>
            <emphasis role="bold">approach</emphasis> can act as a method to standardize clinical
            statements and terminologies by providing abstraction and elimination of unnecessary
            complexity. Instead of a local code being incorrectly mapped to a standard code, the IKM
            platform would provide guidance on the most applicable codes and reduce data loss by
            ensuring a consistent, reproducible format allowing for the same test to be represented
            the same way, every time. Proper achievement requires collaboration across government
            regulatory bodies, public health laboratories, private healthcare systems, and
            In-Vitro-Diagnostic (IVD) device manufacturers. This also extends to the bodies that
            oversee terminology standards and the licensing agreements governing them. </para>
        <para>For successful implementation of an integrated knowledge ecosystem, licensing bodies
            should implement components of open-source licensing, specifically on modification and
            distribution of copyrighted standards. Currently, the process that exists on how
            licenses work together in common spaces and the subsequent requirements are ambiguous.
            Would the implementation of a third-party software trigger licensing restrictions and
            inhibit the willingness of organizations to adopt them? Is the usage of an IKM platform
            by an organization to reconcile local codes considered to be an extension of a modified
            code, disallowed under the existing licensing structure? Some licenses consider any work
            to be referential to be a “derivative” without fully specifying the scope of the
            reference. This is seen, for example, in the form of the GNU's Not Unix (GNU) General
            Public License (GPL) and in references to GPL licensed libraries. [13] The navigation of
            differing licenses and determining the varying responsibilities imposed by them can be a
            costly, time-consuming burden that often acts as a barrier for meaningful progress. It
            can quickly become a convoluted process that inhibits success of implementation,
            unintended by the licensor and their vision of interoperability as seen in LOINC®.
            Licenses must walk a tight line on preventing extension of standards, thereby slowing
            down the evolution of these standards, and allowing full extensions that can subvert the
            standard in and of itself, creating confusion where modifications look to be
            endorsements by the issuing body. [5]</para>
        <para>In practice, strong open-source licenses can encourage the development and evolution
            of standards without subversion of standards through guardrails on community
            contributions. Instead of a few chosen contributors, solutions can be developed openly
            with the collaboration of multiple stakeholders where solutioning becomes more robust
            and agile to the various needs of its users. Reasonable guidelines, such as extensive
            documentation procedures especially in extensions, enhances the trust within open-source
            solutions and allow for the benefits of open-source without allowing an “anything goes”
            mentality where confusion ensues. Additionally, open-source licenses can continue to
            protect against impersonations and false endorsements through their agreements. </para>

                lower layer. It aims to define a standardized form of clinical statements and
                harmonize existing terminologies together into a single system. </para>

            <para>Rather than a broad transformation of existing licenses in a purely open-source
                model, not all components of software and standard licensing require a pivot away
                from proprietary oversight to lead to successful implementation of an IKM ecosystem.
                The commercial usage of aspects of licenses allows for ongoing support and
                maintenance of software and standards. The move towards a permissive license does
                not require a seismic shift in organization structure or its ability monetize its
                commercial license, especially for organizations already promoting open-standards.
                    <emphasis>Allowing for open-licensing encourages improvements of terminology and
                    standards by ancillary bodies and creates a more robust, flexible system that
                    can further adapt into the varying needs of organizations. </emphasis></para>
            <para>Data harmonization improves when foundational layers of Knowledge Architecture are
                integrated into common, collective sources of data. If utilized correctly under a
                Knowledge Architecture, a single-data journey can be completed with integrity intact
                every time. Permissive licensing throughout the foundational architecture,
                terminology knowledge, and statement model layers removes barriers imposed on
                modifications and extensions and instead aids in the creation of common
                understandings of knowledge. The Terminology Knowledge layer within Knowledge
                Architecture oversees the structure of medical terminologies, such as the language
                and semantic hierarchy within data. It is in this layer where the IKM platform
                arbitrates the valid codes and expressions to be used in higher layers. Currently,
                the usage of terminology standards like SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and additional standards
                pose questions regarding compatibility due to modification and extensions
                limitations. The complexity widens when further standards based on other standards
                are integrated further in the terminology layer, like the Laboratory
                Interoperability Data Repository (LIDR) and Tinkar. The loss of data often occurs in
                this layer and breaks the functionality of standards where local codes are mapped to
                the incorrect standard codes. The IKM platform aims to solve this issue by
                harmonizing standards but cannot be successfully implemented unless the underlying
                licenses allow an IKM platform to reconcile variances. In the Statement Model, the
                artifacts as defined below are reused and demonstrate how the data elements should
                be packaged into clinical statements through clinical formatting, such as Health
                Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7 FHIR) or Clinical
                Informational Modeling Initiative (CIMI). The shift towards a permissive license in
                regard to terminologies and standards improves the compatibility of how different
                terminologies work together and thereby is integral to the functionality of higher
                layers and interoperability overall. </para>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <para>Achievement of interoperability within healthcare systems requires a multi-faceted
            approach through the extensive collaboration of various stakeholders involved. In its
            current form many licenses serve as unintended barriers to interoperability where
            downstream patient harm can occur. The increasing interconnectedness of industries and
            partners requires a reevaluation of existing licensing structures that impose barriers
            often antithetical to goals set out by issuing organizations themselves. For solutions
            like an Integrated Knowledge Platform to succeed, licensing must be structured to
            support and encourage growth of ancillary bodies. The adoption of open-source licensing
            encourages diversity of thought where stronger software often results to the benefit of
            organizations. Advocacy towards open-source licensing must also occur internally by
            managing teams. Together, common solutioning reduces siloed company operations, moving
            one step closer to harmonization across the Health IT landscape. </para>
