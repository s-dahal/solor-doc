        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>It is important to recognize the general impact of open and transparent collaboration
            across our Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) efforts and the healthcare ecosystem.
            One framework for collaboration is crowdsourcing, which solicits feedback from large
            groups to develop ideas, products, or services through online communities and allows
            people to share their thoughts voluntarily and asynchronously without a formal
            arrangement. This phenomenon has helped encourage both individual and group
            contributions to drive IKM efforts and development. Crowdsourcing, in part, relies on
            the Wisdom of Crowds, which refers to the collective intelligence and decision-making
            ability of a diverse group, often leading to more accurate outcomes than individual
            decisions. In healthcare, this concept has been applied in various ways, from diagnosing
            rare diseases through crowdsourcing to improving clinical care by harnessing structured
            information-sharing networks among physicians. [1] [2] The collective insight of
            healthcare professionals, patients, and the public can significantly enhance diagnostic
            accuracy, treatment plans, and healthcare innovation.</para>
        <para>This section explores one of the latest healthcare Information Technology (IT) trends
            in decision-making to improve the quality and interoperability of data as they are
            managed, stored, and exchanged across systems. The integration of the Wisdom of Crowds
            with IKM and TermINology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) presents a promising avenue for
            advancing healthcare knowledge management. By leveraging collective intelligence,
            healthcare systems can become more adaptive, responsive, and effective in meeting the
            needs of patients and healthcare professionals.</para>

    <section>
        <title>Background</title>
        <para>In 2006, Jeff Howe from WIRED magazine coined the term “crowdsourcing” and published
            the book “<emphasis role="italic">Crowdsourcing: Why the Power of the Crowd is Driving
                the Future of Business</emphasis>” that provided an in-depth reflection on the
            phenomenon of massive online collaboration. [1] He further explained that crowdsourcing
            originated from large corporations where a handful of computer programmers formed a
            community of like-minded peers who demonstrated they could create more competitive
            products. Crowdsourcing, a behavior of collecting information and collaborating ideas
            through online tools, has a long history dating back to Aristotle who states, “It is
            possible that the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come together
            may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are so, just as public
            dinners to which many contribute are better than those supplied at one man’s cost,” in
                <emphasis role="italic">Politics</emphasis>. [3] </para>
        <para>Dr. Damon Centola, Professor of Communication, Sociology, and Engineering, at
            Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, explores
            crowdsourcing in healthcare and notes how physicians who use the right apps and network
            with other physicians are more likely to revise their recommendations after each round
            and improve their diagnostic reasoning. He also reports that providers who use
            technology diagnose and order treatments more accurately. [1] Technology has not only
            been a great catalyst to improve communication but has also positioned stakeholders to
            more efficiently share their ideas, gather information, and identify best practices
            across various scenarios, ultimately leading to improved care. </para>
        <para>The conversation surrounding crowdsourcing then led to another phenomenon called, The
            Wisdom of Crowds, when James Surowiecki, an American journalist, coined the term to
            describe the characteristics of crowdsourcing. His book examines how large groups have
            made superior decisions in biology, pop culture, behavioral economic, psychology, and
            other fields compared to individual experts. [4]</para>

    <section>
        <title>What is the Impact of Wisdom of Crowds on Healthcare?</title>
        <para>Precious Porter, RN, BSN, introduces the Netflix documentary series “Diagnosis” in her
            article “Crowdsourcing: Using the wisdom of the crowd in health care”. [5] Dr. Lisa
            Sander treated patients with mysterious illnesses and helped them find a support group
            via the internet. The “crowd” consisted of medical doctors, psychologists, caregivers,
            patients, and readers from all over the world. The collective knowledge from these
            stakeholders provided direction for treatment options and, most importantly, kindled the
            source of shared hope to bring a sense of humanity during difficult times. </para>
        <para>Another example of the impact of Crowdsourcing or Wisdom of Crowds is the COVID-19
            pandemic. Crowdsourcing was used to track the development and availability of COVID-19
            vaccines all around the world and facilitated the 3D-printing of medical supplies, such
            as protective gear, masks, face shields, and mechanical ventilators, for healthcare
            organizations in need of supplies during the crisis. [1]</para>
        <para>The healthcare community consists of many different stakeholders, including medical
            providers, IT professionals, informaticists, researchers, marketers, project conveners
            who bring commercial, public and private stakeholders together, and more. Employing the
            Wisdom of Crowds in healthcare offers a diverse array of perspectives and information
            that can facilitate rapid and adaptable solution development. </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>How can we Apply Crowdsourcing and Wisdom of Crowds to IKM and Tinkar?</title>
        <para>Several areas of IKM can benefit from crowdsourcing knowledge and embracing the
            widespread concept of the Wisdom of Crowds. First, by deploying an open-source approach
            to the development of a contributed IKM application and sharing details of Tinkar
            development, including current challenges or issues, the Wisdom of Crowds can generate
            potential solutions and enhance IKM processes. Second, by engaging with stakeholders,
            the crowd can identify solutions to support and maintain high quality and interoperable
            data across medical scenarios. Engaging with the diverse stakeholders across the
            healthcare ecosystem will generate solutions for a wide range of scenarios and lessons
            learned that will inform continuous improvement. </para>
        <para>The main purpose of Tinkar is to standardize the representation of disparate
            healthcare terminology standards used by healthcare professionals in various roles.
            Gathering public feedback from stakeholders and professionals in different areas of
            healthcare who are busy and cannot be together in one place at the same time provides an
            avenue to contribute their invaluable expertise and experience in a free and open forum. </para>
        <para>Crowdsourcing is open ideation and aims to not impede existing internal practices and
            processes. Instead, the integration of crowdsourcing aims to align with the overall
            strategy and provide value for the existing IKM community or organizations that are
            dedicated to developing any aspect of IKM. Developing a clear plan can help maximize the
            use of crowdsourcing and helps crowdsourcing users to stay within defined goals and
            boundaries. While IKM is taking an open-source approach to its development, some areas
            need continued improvement. Wisdom of Crowds and crowdsourcing could contribute to
            addressing the following challenges in the healthcare ecosystem:</para>

            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>By clearly defining areas that need improvement, our team will be able to focus the
            Wisdom of Crowds to support improvements in the areas identified for development. Below
            are a few examples of innovative approaches in healthcare knowledge management and
            decision-making.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Enhancing IKM with Crowdsourced Insights</emphasis>: The
            integration of crowdsourced insights into IKM systems can significantly enhance
            healthcare data management. For instance, in the context of obesity and cancer research,
            crowdsourcing has been used to improve the quality of knowledge bases by incorporating
            public contributions into the information extraction process. [6] This approach can be
            extended to other areas in healthcare, where public input can provide valuable insights
            and fill gaps in existing knowledge.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Case Study: OC-2-KB System</emphasis>: The Obesity and Cancer to
            Knowledge Base (OC-2-KB) system is an example of integrating crowdsourcing into
            healthcare knowledge management. This system uses natural language processing and
            machine learning techniques to extract semantic triples from PubMed abstracts related to
            obesity and cancer. Crowdsourcing is then employed to refine the extracted facts,
            enhancing the quality and reliability of the information in the knowledge base.
            [6]</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Tinkar Enhanced by Real-Time, Crowdsourced Healthcare
                Data</emphasis>: Tinkar's role in standardizing healthcare terminology can be
            augmented by incorporating real-time, crowdsourced healthcare data. This approach can
            ensure that the terminology used in healthcare systems remains up-to-date and reflective
            of current clinical practices and patient experiences. For example, crowdsourced
            contributions can help identify emerging medical terms and concepts, which can then be
            integrated into Tinkar's repository, ensuring its relevance and applicability.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Hypothetical Scenario: Emergency Response</emphasis>: In an
            emergency response scenario, such as a pandemic, the combination of crowdsourced data,
            IKM, and Tinkar can be particularly effective. Real-time data from healthcare
            professionals and the public can be gathered and integrated into IKM systems, providing
            a comprehensive view of the situation. Tinkar can ensure that the terminology used in
            this data is standardized, facilitating effective communication and decision-making
            across different healthcare systems and regions.</para>
        <para>While the synergy between these elements offers significant potential, there are
            challenges, that we will discuss alter in this section, to consider, including ensuring
            the accuracy and reliability of crowdsourced data, maintaining privacy and security, and
            effectively integrating this data into existing healthcare IT systems.</para>

        <title>Is Crowdsourcing Reliable?</title>
        <para>The Wisdom of Crowds in healthcare offers several advantages, including diverse
            perspectives, rapid information gathering, and innovative problem-solving. [6] However,
            the approach also has limitations of potential misinformation, anonymity, unchecked
            credentials, breaches that compromise intellectual property, and identity theft.
            Additionally, a framework to review ideas generated from Wisdom of Crowds by established
            Subject Matter Experts will ensure contributions are impactful, meet quality assurance
            standards, and are feasible. Relevant stakeholders will need to address these risks to
            govern the wisdom of the crowds under a better set of legitimate policy and regulations
            for virtual exchanges. </para>
        <para>As we continue to refine IKM efforts and incorporate crowdsourced and Wisdom of Crowds
            contributions, our team will build upon the lessons learned and best practices from
            other efforts in this space. The following recommendations will support any healthcare
            organizations with a strong interest in obtaining high-quality contributions through
            crowdsourcing. </para>
        <para>1.<emphasis role="bold"> Develop robust frameworks</emphasis>. Robust frameworks must
            effectively leverage collective intelligence for gathering, integrating, and analyzing
            crowd sourced information in order to maintain the accuracy and reliability of obtained
            information from the public. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">2. Keep ethical considerations and privacy
                concerns</emphasis><emphasis role="bold">. </emphasis>As addressed in other volumes,
            while crowdsourcing offers unique advantages, a simultaneous priority must be to protect
            patient data and ensure ethical use of crowdsourced information. </para>
