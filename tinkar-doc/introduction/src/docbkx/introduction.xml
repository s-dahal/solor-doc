  <title>Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar) Overview</title>
  <para>Over the past decades, biomedical terminologies have increasingly been recognized as key
    resources for knowledge management, data integration, and decision support [1]. Acceleration and
    development of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems has precipitated the emergence of
    “standard terminologies” and their widespread adoption in the clinical community. These include
    Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the Logical Observation
    Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. The availability of these clinical
    terminologies through the terminology services of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource
    (FHIR) is facilitating their usage in support of interoperability in healthcare. </para>
  <para>Interoperability requires standardized semantics based on reference terminology provided by
    standards development organizations, professional organizations, or government agencies. These
    organizations publish their content with the intention of licensing it to health information
    technology (IT) vendors, providers, and research organizations. In the U.S., the core clinical
    reference terminology is based on SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm. Healthcare organizations must
    adopt and integrate subsets or modules of various reference terminology and manage references,
    dependencies, versions, and releases. It is important for the integrity of medical records that
    the change history of concepts and value sets can be managed and tracked to allow the exchange
    of either current or retrospective medical records. Therefore, enterprise terminology requires
    integrated terminology using a common representation and management.</para>
  <para>Despite the need to use standard terminologies in a highly integrated way, there is no
    standard representation across SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm, etc. Some partnerships have been
    created among development teams to facilitate interoperability and minimize duplication of
    effort. Further integration has been proposed but will require additional resources to bring
    these terminologies closer together. However, while this evolution leads to greater
    compatibility and interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm is non-trivial
    as these terminologies use different formalisms and tools for their representation. Various
    terminologies have different semantics, models, release cycles, and versioning mechanisms [1].
    While there is recognition that terminologies are not standardized at the exchange level, there
    is no consensus about harmonized next steps to solve the challenges. </para>
  <para>This document focuses on the need for – and logical specification of – a Terminology
    Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar). The Tinkar Reference Model is a logical model that describes
    the standardized model for terminology and change management.    Tinkar provides an architecture
    that delivers integrated terminology to the enterprise and its information systems. In doing so,
    it addresses the differences in management and structure across reference terminology, local
    concepts, and code lists/value sets. </para>
  <para>The Capability Maturity Model is a development model and can be viewed as a set of
    structured levels that describe how well the behaviors, practices, and processes of an
    organization can reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes. There are five levels
    defined along the continuum of the Capability Maturity Model (see below). The model provides a
    theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level
    to the next. An implementation of the Tinkar Specification can provide a single representation
    for all terminologies required in the U.S. and other countries, while also providing a better
    foundation for maturing change management models as described by the Capability Maturity Model

  <para>Tinkar aims to adhere to the following statement from a publication about developments in
    clinical terminologies in the 2018 Yearbook of Medical Informatics [1]: “The benefits of the
    integrated terminologies in terms of homogenous semantics and inherent interoperability should,
    however, outweigh the complexity added to the system.” This specification provides the
    foundation of a knowledge architecture that is intended to integrate reference terminology from
    distributors (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm) with local concepts to support interoperable
    information semantics across the enterprise. </para>
  <section>
    <title>Motivation: Why Tinkar?</title>
    <para>Information systems that are used across the healthcare enterprise record and manage
      clinical data using clinical statements and clinical terminologies in non-standardized ways.
      Interoperability specifications aim to require terminology bindings to concepts, code systems,
      and reusable value sets. Currently, there is variation in clinical data exchange across the
      enterprise, as existing payloads and clinical statements use inconsistent and highly variable
      enterprise terminologies. The management of the concepts, code systems, and value sets is
      non-trivial because developers, implementers, and end users are forced to manage “unnecessary
      complexity.” For example:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Representation of medications: RxNorm codes overlap with CVX codes. Investigational
          vaccines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not represented in RxNorm,
          CVX, or SNOMED CT®.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Representation of COVID-19 result codes are inconsistent and are not equivalent (e.g.,
          detected, undetected, positive, negative, etc.).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>As a result of these complexities, there are many ways to say the same thing using
      standard terminologies and standard formats. The Institute of Medicine report, <emphasis
        role="italic">Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better
        Care</emphasis>, highlighted the unintended consequences of health IT-induced harm that can
      result in serious injury and death due to dosing errors, failure to detect serious illnesses,
      and delayed treatment due to poor human-computer interactions, confusing clinical terminology,
      or unreliable data quality [3]. Despite the widespread understanding of the importance of the
      quality of clinical data, there is currently a lack of integration and management of clinical
      terminologies across the healthcare enterprise. </para>
    <para>Tinkar intends to support integration of clinical terminology and local concepts to
      support increased data quality for interoperable clinical information. High-quality clinical
      data enables healthcare systems across the enterprise to conduct robust and meaningful data
      analysis and increase overall interoperability, which ultimately enhances quality of care
      across all medical facilities. </para>

    <title>About Tinkar</title>
    <para>Tinkar provides the foundation of a knowledge architecture that is intended to integrate
      reference terminology from distributors (e.g., SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm) with local concepts
      to support interoperable information semantics across the enterprise.</para>
    <para>This specification introduces an agile approach to terminology design and formatting that
      promotes the use of self-describing data. It is a shift from hard-coded models that have been
      favored due to their prescriptive nature but have shown limited flexibility and extensibility.
      This specification is similar to FHIR as it places the focus on a self-describing, extensible
      approach to representing terminology. Therefore, Tinkar aims to be both self-describing and
      completely machine processed:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Self-describing machine-readable representation of terminology, such that if an
          application can process the metadata, it should be able to import the content/concepts and
          make it available to enterprise applications.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The machine-readable terminology could generate human-readable documentation so that
          business analysts and developers can understand and apply it correctly.</para>

    <title>Tinkar Objectives and Purpose – Manage Terminology and Change</title>
    <para>This specification describes the requirements and characteristics of systems required to
      manage terminology produced by a variety of organizations across a healthcare enterprise. This
      foundation must allow enterprise to extend terminology standards and implement extensions in a
      timely fashion.</para>
    <para>This specification is intended to support healthcare organizations’ standard terminology
      modules, value sets, and coding systems as well as local terms and equivalence
      mappings.</para>
    <para>A standard-based Tinkar specification is necessary to support the operation of a variety
      of systems intended to deliver knowledge management for terminology to vendors, providers, and
      even standards-development organizations, like Health Level Seven (HL7). </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Related Efforts</title>
    <para>Previous efforts have attempted to create a common set of terminology capabilities and
      services by specifying a single predefined structure for managing terminology. Unfortunately,
      a hardwired structure that works for one standard may not work for another. The inability to
      integrate content across terminology standards is a barrier to implementing services and
      modules that can deliver integrated concepts, code lists, and value sets required by
      enterprise systems for treatment, research, business process automation, quality measures, and
      outcome analysis. </para>

        <para>Data analysis and research require integrated terminology to analyze aggregated

          RxNorm).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus is a compilation of multiple
      sources organized into ‘concepts’ that contain terms from many sources. The terms within a
      concept are declared synonyms by UMLS editors. However, its use in terminology systems has
      limited utility for several reasons. First, UMLS concepts are created on lexically-based rules
      and use very little of the additional information (relationships between concepts) that may be
      available from the source terminology. It does not permit classification to identify cases of
      possible missed synonymy. Second, issues of currency occur because of dyssynchrony of release
      dates between source terminologies and the UMLS itself. Third, the UMLS does not support a
      contribution model. That is, it is a static file that cannot be amended to support additional
      terms that may be required to fill gaps in existing terminologies subsumed by the
      Metathesaurus; it does not support extensions. Lastly, there is no efficient format for
      sharing integrated Metathesaurus content (though there is Rich Release Format [RRF]). The UMLS
      is not an architecture for terminology management. It may only serve as a reference, noting
      the aforementioned limitations. An implementation of Tinkar may help address these
      limitations. </para>
    <para>Common Terminology Services 2<superscript>TM</superscript>
        (CTS2<superscript>TM</superscript>) is an architecture for terminology management that
      supports history retrieval, though it does not support an arbitrarily granular change set
      model for versioning. The Tinkar specification, in contrast, provides that every new
      assertion, whether a new component or a change to an existing component, must have a precise
      version coordinate that govern granular change control. CTS2<superscript>TM</superscript>
      asserts a specific terminology model and does not support unanticipated properties with a
      self-describing model.</para>
    <para>The U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) is an amalgamation of various encoding standards. The standards being identified
      for specific data elements do not themselves provide consistency for how encoding is
      represented, how those encoding standards change over time, and how those encoding standards
      are distributed. As demonstrated by COVID-19 data needs, coordinated extension of content,
      timely distribution of updates, and consistency of representation are required to effectively
      respond to needs of public health and syndromic surveillance. Tinkar could help make it easier
      to standardize the representation, distribution, version and configuration management, and
      ability to share extensions to the USCDI as well as the underlying terminology systems
      themselves.</para>

    <title>Benefits of Self-Describing Architecture</title>
    <para>Tinkar is self-describing and completely machine-processed. A self-describing architecture
      is defined in a report from Queensland University of Technology as follows: “[t]he idea is
      that self-descriptions of data and other techniques would allow context-understanding programs
      to selectively find what users want, or for programs to work on behalf of humans and
      organizations to make them more scalable, efficient and productive.” [9] Key advantages of a
      self-describing architecture (or metadata driven architecture) [10] include the following
      details: </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Changes can be reviewed immediately</emphasis> – Every action or
      change by end users can be immediately previewed or tested, without needing any compilation or
      deployment process. The review can also be done before saving or publishing the changes, which
      makes it an interactive development environment for designers to create functionality in an
      iterative manner.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Version control with easy rollback</emphasis> – Every time any
      changes are made to published terminology artifacts, the historic versions of the metadata
      files are maintained. This enables easy version control and rollback when necessary. Every
      time a change is made to any artifact, the prior version that existed is archived. When a
      developer needs to roll back to the prior version, it can be achieved easily. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Any data source can be added </emphasis>– A self-describing
      architecture facilitates the ability for multiple types of terminology data sources to be
      connected to the system.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Define granular coordinates and configuration management</emphasis>
      – The functionality for defining granular, user-defined settings and controls for granular
      elements of clinical terminology management is supported. This includes create, read, and
      append settings, as well as management of individual elements, like fields or other controls. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Faster extensions</emphasis> – A benefit of a self-describing
      architecture is that it can abstract a lot of the deep internal complexities that makes
      development of standard terminologies complicated. This approach can improve processes around
      extensions to terminology. </para>

      per minute for a patient’s pulse), but also procedural context (e.g., pulse oximetry, manual)
      about past observations or requests for future interventions. While two quantitative
      measurements may be the same, the procedural information could indicate meaningful semantic
      differences and lead to different clinical interpretation and treatment. As information is
      exchanged across systems, the solution requires a common understanding of data, a method to
      support knowledge-representation, and clinical decision rules based on common terminology and
      statements. Each component must address an aspect, and together need to address the
      requirements of clinicians. Current HL7 standard implementations rely on profiles and
      templates to disambiguate statement and terminology, and provide sufficient precision for
      transactions, documents, and standards-based application programming interface (APIs). Therefore, the architectural approach
      described here is applicable to standards organizations developing interoperability for
      enterprise and project-specific implementations in equal measure.</para>
    <para>Functional decomposition—often referred to as a <glossterm
        baseform="Separation of Concerns">Separation of Concerns</glossterm> (SoC)—across components
      or sections with a specific purpose is a foundational design principle for complex system
      architecture. SoC allows a complete system to be subdivided into distinct sections or
      components with well-defined functionality and dependencies. If successful, this approach
      allows individual sections to be able to be <emphasis>reused</emphasis>, as well as designed,
      implemented, and updated <emphasis>independently</emphasis> to address emerging
        <emphasis>requirements</emphasis>. This is especially useful and important in a medical
      context given how many different health information and clinical terminology projects are
      ongoing at any given time. Efforts are often uncoordinated and led by disparate and unrelated
      standards development organizations. In these cases, SoC allows teams to work independently,
      in coordination with each other, and reuse the resulting artifacts.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Foundational Architecture</emphasis> – The Foundational layer of the
      Knowledge Architecture provides the common elements of interoperability, such as: object
      identity, versioning, modularity, and knowledge representation. It includes (a) the foundation
      and building blocks of the common model; (b) how the repeatable transformation process of
      disparate standards into the common model promotes interoperability with other environments;
      and (c) how the modules of the architecture are tightly version controlled over time. The
      Tinkar Reference Model belongs in this layer. </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Terminology Knowledge </emphasis>- The Terminology Knowledge layer is
      responsible for structured sets of medical terms and codes that <emphasis>define</emphasis>
      concepts of interest, including descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy.
      SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm are part of this layer. It defines what valid codes or
      expressions may be used by higher level layers. </para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Statement Model</emphasis> – The Statement Model layer is
      responsible for defining how data elements are combined to create a statement. This layer
      reuses the artifacts defined in the Terminology Knowledge layer. The analysis normal form
      (ANF) Reference Model [11] belongs in this layer.</para>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Assertional Knowledge</emphasis> – The Assertional Knowledge layer
      makes use of the Terminology Knowledge layer concepts to specify
        <emphasis>non-defining</emphasis> facts that may be used by procedural knowledge algorithms.
      An example fact might be that “thiazide diuretics treat hypertension.” Assertional Knowledge
      may also indicate what symptoms may be associated with a disorder. </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Procedural Knowledge</emphasis> – The Procedural Knowledge layer, also
      known as <emphasis>imperative knowledge</emphasis>, is the knowledge exercised in the
      performance of some task. An example would be determining a hypertension treatment plan by
      analyzing a combination of a patient’s clinical statements and the available assertional
      knowledge. The procedural knowledge is responsible for information about standard ways to
      carry out specific procedures, as well as other procedural guidelines, (e.g., treatment
      protocols for diseases and order sets focused on certain patient situations). Procedural
      knowledge, together with assertional knowledge, enables clinical decision support, quality
      measurement, and patient safety. This layer relies on the architectural foundation and
      terminology layers, incorporates the statement model for information retrieval, and uses the
      assertional knowledge. Procedural knowledge artifacts may include clinical alert rules,
      reminders, etc., that trigger actions or recommend interventions.</para>

          <para>At the Terminology Knowledge layer there may be various codes and terms from
            disparate source terminologies to define a concept (e.g., hypertension). Ideally, these
            overlapping codes and terms would be oriented to the same parent concept during the

            hypertension vs. renal hypertension) within a standard data structure to facilitate
            information exchange or retrieval, such as within a standards-based clinical statement

          <para>Finally, the Procedural Knowledge layer provides algorithms to analyze clinical
            statements about a patient, in combination with the Assertional Knowledge, to recommend
            a treatment protocol for different kinds of hypertension, including the considerations
            of, (e.g., patient age, co-morbidities etc., which can be generated by an electronic
            clinical decision support system [Statement + Assertional layers]). This layer adds
            support for workflow and conditional logic (i.e., if-then-else).</para>

    <para>A clear separation of concerns enables the isosemantic transformation of standards-based
      clinical statements to normal form in the Statement Model layer by decoupling structure from

    <para>HL7 relies on implementation guides (for V2, CDA, and FHIR) to add sufficient terminology
      knowledge to standards-based clinical statements. Terminology constraints documented as
      profiles or templates are the mechanism to create interoperable implementation guides from
      health IT standards. Only after the Terminology Knowledge is fully defined can the
      standards-based statements be used to support business and workflow decision points consistent
      with the Assertional and Procedural layers described above. </para>

    <title>About this Document</title>
    <para>This document describes how encoded clinical data can be improved with a terminology
      management model. This terminology can be unified for HL7 and non-HL7 systems. The Terminology
      Knowledge Architecture, known as Tinkar, treats terminology in a common way for managing
      enhanced patient care and improved record keeping. The unification of models such as SNOMED
      CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm will allow more robust computable medical records. The following
      sections contain the Tinkar Reference Model, along with illustrative examples as to the
      complexity and necessity of type of structure. </para>
    <para>Tinkar will take different language sources and cohesively manage terminology data.
      Section 2 lays out the specific business requirements necessary for this task. The model
      representation is outlined in Section 3. Section 4 shows how Tinkar brings together the
      biomedical terminologies by a common description format. An implementation of the Tinkar
      specification can be used to fill the gaps between the common HL7 Terminologies and other
      systems like SNOMED CT®, RxNorm, Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM), etc. The result is
      the distribution and sharing of cohesive data across all platforms. </para>
